        <h3>Metro Schedule App</h3>
        <p>Once again, it started bored in class, just a year later. This class is the worst bythe way, they gave us a
          group of 10 people to make the work that would take 3 or 4 people. Besides that, the expectations the teacher
          has for us are about as high as a kindergarden. Take note that I say &quot;in class&quot; as a very vague
          term, I have a really stupid habit. I hate arriving just in time, so I like to get to class a little
          early....... 2 hours. I wake up at 7am so I can be in the classroom alone for almost 2 hours. In that time I
          get most of my ideas though. </p>
        <p>Here in Portugal we have an app for the buses where you choose a stop and it will tell you the next buses
          that will arrive over the next hour or so. However, for the metros, there is no such thing, so I usually keep
          the pdf with the timetables tabbed on my phone, and it&#39;s a pain to use on a tiny screen. Arriving to
          &quot;class&quot; one day I remembered that I had gotten a bunch of experience with <em>.json</em> files the
          previous semester because of a project (I don&#39;t think it&#39;s serious enough to note it in here, I just
          did the coding for a &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; site).</p>
        <p>So I went to the site of Metro do Porto (Is it really doxxing myself when my country only has 2 populated
          cities?) and looked for any download links that would have the metro schedules. I was fully expecting to
          having to exatract the numbers from the pdf to an excel spreadsheet. But, to my surprise, they actually had
          the schedules on a <em>GTFS</em> format. Do you know what that is? I shure as hell didn&#39;t, but it turns
          out to be the standart way to format shedules for google services. In the <em>GTFS</em> format, you have a
          <em>zip</em> folder with various <em>txt</em> documents organized like:
          <code>BU0,6:01:00,6:01:00,5708,0,,,,</code>.
        </p>
        <p>My first instinct was to find which one of these files had the times (it was <em>calendar.txt</em>) and I
          could probably do this entire project with little more than <em>awk</em>.</p>
        <p>So instead, I spent the first entire day trying to find a way to convert <em>GTFS</em> to <em>json</em>.</p>
        <p>And of the second I gave up and make a script with <em>awk</em> to convert those files to a giant
          <em>json</em> with only the information I cared about....
        </p>
        <p>And then I decided to use linux&#39;s built-in <em>jq</em> command instead of actualy JavaScript......</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>Now that I type this I see how stupid it trully was............</p>
        <p>At the moment of writting, it is still a work-in-progress, but I can give some insigth to the problems I
          faced. I had to divide the task in many micro problems and solve them 1 by 1, so I think I can just decribe
          some of them. </p>
        <p>With the giant <em>Json</em> made, I had to figure out what I wanted to show the user. The easiest part by
          far. Get the date to figure out if I needed the schedule for Saturday, Sunday or Weekdays. Secondly, asking
          the user to say what station they were in and printing a list of all metros that go there in that schedule.
          But that caused me a really stupid problem. There are multiples files inside the <em>zip</em> folder that I
          downloaded, and my script to turn them into <em>json</em> files only worked for one at a time, and the file
          with the metro times was different than the one with the station names so it only used ids. So I had to run a
          new file throught the script and make the programme take the inpute station name and look for the
          correspondent station id. And with that, I could finally dig for times.</p>
        <p><img src="/data/2/badcode.jpg" alt="badcode">
          Listen, this is not my finest coding moment.</p>
        <p>After that, made the user specify the exact metro line so that I can look for the perfect trip ids to print
          out. Then I realised I had a new problem where I have no way of looking for every single metro line looking
          for metros. Instead I can only see one line at time, and, sure, that is usefull for 80% of the metro users,
          but still not ideal. And I am currently working on it.... whenever I feel like.</p>
        <p>Lastly, there&#39;s directions. Which were not that hard to implement, just counter intuitive. The trip ids
          for each combination of line and schedule go up to 99, 0..49 for direction 1 and 50..99 for direction 2. So I
          just threw it in a <em>for</em> loop and called it a day.</p>

        <h3>Maps</h3>
        <p>As you can probably tell by now, whenever I get bored in class, I seem to go deeper into the spectrum.</p>
        <p>There are a few projects that have started from my boredom, but most of them aren&#39;t big enough for me to
          document, that&#39;s why I&#39;m making thes page. Here are some of the weird dumb projects I do to pass the
          time.</p>
        <p><strong>I take pictures of maps and try to make them look realistic</strong></p>
        <p>I know this sounds like the most utterly specific hobbie ever thought of......There&#39;s no &quot;but&quot;,
          that&#39;s it. </p>
        <p>Here are the ones I have so far</p>

        <p>I don&#39;t know why I do this, but it is quite fun.</p>
